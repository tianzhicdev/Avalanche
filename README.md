# Project Avalanche

The force of humanityâ€™s pursue for more efficiency is like Avalanche: Unstoppable


Avalanche is an Immutable Public DB where a relatively short id can represent a piece of information of arbitrary length. 
The internet today has a lot of the same infomation flying around. To reduce meaningless transfer of the data, we invented CDN. FACEBOOK, TIC TOC, TWITTER and etc all use it. But, they do not share, even they often spread the same content. The info barriers between companies are costly, we need to break them - hence we need a Immutable Public DB. It is useful for recording truth too.


Data structure:

[numeric, cell_size(4k)]
